#Defining a variable using snake_case (recommended by official python)

full_name = "Fernando"


#Concatenation with +

welcome  = "Hi " + " How are you?"



#F-string concatenation

welcome = f"hi {full_name} how are you?"


#Membership Operators (in / not in)

print("Fernando" in welcome)
print("Fernando" not in welcome)



#Just to know the convention naming files, variables, functions, classes and constants

#snake_case for files, variables and functions
#PascalCase for classes
#UPPER_CASE for constants
